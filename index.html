		<p>Hello, my name is Cindy, I am 19 years old, and I am in my second year at IESEG. My mother is Chinese and my father is French, so I have always lived between the two countries. It is by following my Asian side, that I started to find my two passions: mangas, and drawing.</p>

		<h2>Mangas 🇯🇵 </h2>
		<p>I love manga, I've been watching them since I was born, and reading them since I could read. Manga is a big part of my life, I have learned a lot from it, especially about life, relationships, and history. I have almost 500 mangas in my collection, when I was younger I used to spend all my money on them, my parents were going crazy! My favorite manga is One piece, a manga about pirates.

		<h2>Studies 📚</h2>
		<p>I am in my second year of business school at IESEG. I had planned to do a university exchange in Japan but it was finally cancelled because of Covid so I am now going to China in Beijing.   </p>

		<h2>Drawing 🖍️ </h2>
		<p>
		 My second passion comes from my first one, drawing. At the beginning, I started by copying the graphics I saw in my mangas. I learned by trying, by watching tutorials on YouTube. Little by little, I developed my own style, opening myself to different types of "drawings", I went into the realistic, then into the abstract. I couldn't stop at drawings, so I started painting, gluing, but also taking pictures.
